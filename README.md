Research Statement
<hr><br>
Dr. Bhraguram T M received his PhD in CSE from Dr. M.G.R Educational and Research Institute, Chennai, India and M Tech and M.Sc Degree under computer science and engineering streams. His research interests include framework generation for Outlier detection in Time series data streams and data mining under cybercrime activities. This area is coming under the leading young research field Data Mining. His Studies have focused on high level data generation domains like weather forecast, Banking sector, Sensex level etc. He has published many research articles in peer reviewed journals and have presented work at several national and International scientific conferences. Currently he is working as an Assistant Professor in department of IT in Shinas College of Technology, Shinas, Sultanate of Oman. His current working atmosphere is a research lab for post graduate professionals and guiding them to develop high level computational systems.
Motivation to do a PhD in areas of Computational Sciences
Since he has passed his M Tech Computer Science and Engineering after My M.Sc Computer Science Degree, He Realized the need of real research oriented career for his life. Without any hesitation he have chosen the area under Data mining for various computational systems including energy plants, weather forecasting, and other high level computational domains. Looking forward to his career he is confident to supply the computational contribution to the above areas which are the leading talks today. Since PhD is a real Research oriented environment he was very much excited to get into it and to build a Research oriented career.
He had conducted many Research oriented activities for the students including Workshops, Conferences, and Seminars etc. The area of his research work is under A Distillation approach to solitude sustainability in Information Mining for cyber-crime activities in European Union and Asian Peninsula.
